HPI
I have successfully been able to demonstrate to her the unconscious process of compartmentalization of affect that has pervaded her life, and to show her how this compartmentalization corresponds with her conscious orientation toward "achievement" and "success." The normal amount of amnesia of or resistance to these concepts, however, is evident. But in analyzing these concepts she continues to learn that she has defined success in unrealistic terms, terms that must be understood along the lines of some formative childhood experiences. As she is more and more able to associate to those times, and to understand the present in terms of her attempts to correct for the past, then she is also more able to contact long repressed feelings. These moments are experienced by her as significant and meaningful. I have also been able to show patient how her mood lability and anxiety result also from these same basic processes. As she gets more a hold of these connections, things in her life change in a positive way.

Patient continues to report significant improvements in her mood stability and levels. Today she talked primarily about the health emergency of her son who is going to require surgery. I provided empathetic and reflective listening and worked to help patient to clarify her thoughts and feelings. 


MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    APPEARANCE:  appropriate, professional  BEHAVIOR:   cooperative, forthcoming  AFFECT: mostly congruent to ideation   MOOD: "okay," anxious, worried THOUGHT PROCESSES:  clear, coherent, goal directed  THOUGHT CONTENT:  Significant for positive future orientation.  No current suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent or plan. Intrusive and obsessive thoughts. No evidence of dysperceptions.  COGNITION:  Intelligence appears to be average.  Cognitively, patient is alert and oriented x 4.  Concentration and memory are intact.  INSIGHT/JUDGMENT:  Fair/Good.  IMPULSE CONTROL:  intact. 


DIAGNOSIS:  
Generalized anxiety disorder
		


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN:
Once weekly, insight oriented psychotherapy.

HPI
I have successfully been able to demonstrate to her the unconscious process of compartmentalization of affect that has pervaded her life, and to show her how this compartmentalization corresponds with her conscious orientation toward "achievement" and "success." The normal amount of amnesia of or resistance to these concepts, however, is evident. But in analyzing these concepts she continues to learn that she has defined success in unrealistic terms, terms that must be understood along the lines of some formative childhood experiences. As she is more and more able to associate to those times, and to understand the present in terms of her attempts to correct for the past, then she is also more able to contact long repressed feelings. These moments are experienced by her as significant and meaningful. I have also been able to show patient how her mood lability and anxiety result also from these same basic processes. As she gets more a hold of these connections, things in her life change in a positive way.

Patient continues to report significant improvements in her mood stability and levels. Today she reported that her son had had his surgery and that it went well. I provided empathetic and reflective listening and worked to help patient to sort out and articulate her thoughts and feelings. Patient also continues to articulate the substantial and seemingly sustainable changes that she's been able to effect in her life and mental health. 


MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    APPEARANCE:  appropriate, professional  BEHAVIOR:   cooperative, forthcoming  AFFECT: mostly congruent to ideation   MOOD: "okay," anxious, worried "but good" THOUGHT PROCESSES:  clear, coherent, goal directed  THOUGHT CONTENT:  Significant for positive future orientation.  No current suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent or plan. Intrusive and obsessive thoughts. No evidence of dysperceptions.  COGNITION:  Intelligence appears to be average.  Cognitively, patient is alert and oriented x 4.  Concentration and memory are intact.  INSIGHT/JUDGMENT:  Fair/Good.  IMPULSE CONTROL:  intact. 


DIAGNOSIS:  
Generalized anxiety disorder
		


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN:
Once weekly, insight oriented psychotherapy.

Today patient talked about her continued improved mood and affect control. We were able to see some ways that her old thinking persists, though at a much lower "volume" than before. She continues to abstain from alcohol, to exercise regularly, and to mind her diet. She has gained a great deal of insight into herself, and has demonstrated the ability to put that insight to use.

HPI
I have begun to gain a different and better perspective on how patient thinks and what he tends to share in session with me. Today I used this changed perspective to intervene with him differently. I brought attention to that he appears to feel "stuck" and put words more directly to his struggle in a way that made more real and tangible the effect of his homeschooling on his social, emotional, and academic development. Though I was more confrontational with patient, so too was I empathetic and cognizant of his experience of me and the session. Patient became emotional at various points throughout the session, but also seemed to understand and even agree with my observations. The end result was to help patient to face the disadvantage that he's been placed (i.e., by having been allowed to drop out of school) in more directly.

MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    APPEARANCE:  tall, casually dressed (patient tends to wear latency-aged clothing.  t-shirt, and mesh pants, clean)  BEHAVIOR:  cooperative, engaged   AFFECT:  neutral/anxious, punctuated by tearfulness     MOOD:   "okay," anxious   THOUGHT PROCESSES:  sporadically interrupted by his high levels of anxiety, mostly goal oriented and coherent  THOUGHT CONTENT:  Significant for positive future orientation.  No current suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent or plan. Intrusive and obsessive thoughts. No evidence of dysperceptions.  COGNITION:  Intelligence appears to be average.  Cognitively, patient is alert and oriented x 4.  Concentration and memory are intact.  INSIGHT/JUDGMENT:  Fair/Good.  IMPULSE CONTROL:  intact. 



DIAGNOSIS:  
Panic Disorder


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN:  Begin insight oriented psychotherapy, twice weekly. Meet regularly with his mother as well.

HPI
Patient reported today that he had been bothered by something that I said to him last time. It was when I confronted him about not knowing what he was talking about (i.e., seeming to anxiously fill the time without having a goal in mind). This led to a conversation about wanting to be treated "like an equal" and having decided that he was "an adult now, and wanted to be treated like one." Even as he said this he expressed some doubts about it, and this opened the opportunity to talk some about what makes one an adult, and whether he and I were actually equals, and how he got the idea that he can "decide" to be an adult anyway. The session seemed productive and rapport seemed reestablished by the end.

I continue to work with patient to help him to see more clearly that he has been put at a disadvantage by having been allowed to quit school, and to help him to face the challenge of reintegrating into the societal mainstream. From this vantage point his anxiety is more understandable and we are able to be more effectively curious about what he stands to lose (i.e., having complete control over his schedule, not being challenged by those around him, being waited on by his mother, etc.).

I continue to work with patient to help him to see more clearly that he has been put at a disadvantage by having been allowed to quit school, and to help him to face the challenge of reintegrating into the societal mainstream. From this vantage point his anxiety is more understandable and we are able to be more effectively curious about what he stands to lose (i.e., having complete control over his schedule, not being challenged by those around him, being waited on by his mother, etc.). 

MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    APPEARANCE:  tall, casually dressed (patient tends to wear latency-aged clothing.  t-shirt, and mesh pants, clean)  BEHAVIOR:  cooperative, engaged   AFFECT:  neutral/anxious, punctuated by tearfulness     MOOD:   "okay," anxious   THOUGHT PROCESSES:  sporadically interrupted by his high levels of anxiety, mostly goal oriented and coherent  THOUGHT CONTENT:  Significant for positive future orientation.  No current suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent or plan. Intrusive and obsessive thoughts. No evidence of dysperceptions.  COGNITION:  Intelligence appears to be average.  Cognitively, patient is alert and oriented x 4.  Concentration and memory are intact.  INSIGHT/JUDGMENT:  Fair/Good.  IMPULSE CONTROL:  intact. 



DIAGNOSIS:  
Panic Disorder


RECOMMENDATIONS/PLAN:  Begin insight oriented psychotherapy, twice weekly. Meet regularly with his mother as well.

Patient and I continued down similar lines today. He started by talking about how he will not be able to complete some projects that he was hoping to be able to, due to circumstances outside of his control. He worked to put some words to this disappointment which he also noted wasn't too strong. His mind then moved to the possibility of taking classes at a community college soon. There remains something about this that makes him anxious. I worked to help patient to articulate and gain perspective on this anxiety, and to integrate his feelings about not being able to complete his own projects. As the session progressed, patient's associations led him to consider his family dynamics and specifically his father's role in the family. Significant links between his experience of his father and his anxiety were developed.

I continue to orient patient to treatment, to assess his symptoms, and to help him to articulate goals for treatment. Patient's symptoms are growing more and more clear, even if the underlying causes of those symptoms remain obscure. I help by providing empathetic and reflective listening, and working to help patient to articulate his thoughts and label/explore his emotions. This latter part is difficult for patient, who tends to get caught up in elaborate structures of thought. This is a dynamic that I'm actively interpreting. More and more our sessions are crystallizing around his experience of being disconnected from others, and the profound loneliness that results. He goes back and forth in his mind about whether this dynamic results from something within himself, or whether it is basically the world that's at fault. Often, patient's emotional experience surrounding this issue is quite intense and he can sometimes use language indicating a high level of hopelessness. In these times, I assess for suiciality which, thus far, has been soundly denied. Though patient reports that our sessions are only moderately helpful to him as a "stand in" for a more authentic type of relationship, so too does he report not wishing to discontinue. In my clinical judgment, maintaining a connection with patient seems important not only in the hope of better understanding how he keeps himself isolated from those around him, but in buffering against his hopelessness.

HPI
I continue to orient patient to treatment, to assess his symptoms, and to help him to articulate goals for treatment. Patient's symptoms are growing more and more clear, even if the underlying causes of those symptoms remain obscure. I help by providing empathetic and reflective listening, and working to help patient to articulate his thoughts and label/explore his emotions. This latter part is difficult for patient, who tends to get caught up in elaborate structures of thought. This is a dynamic that I'm actively interpreting. More and more our sessions are crystallizing around his experience of being disconnected from others, and the profound loneliness that results. He goes back and forth in his mind about whether this dynamic results from something within himself, or whether it is basically the world that's at fault. Often, patient's emotional experience surrounding this issue is quite intense and he can sometimes use language indicating a high level of hopelessness. In these times, I assess for suiciality which, thus far, has been soundly denied. Though patient reports that our sessions are only moderately helpful to him as a "stand in" for a more authentic type of relationship, so too does he report not wishing to discontinue. In my clinical judgment, maintaining a connection with patient seems important not only in the hope of better understanding how he keeps himself isolated from those around him, but in buffering against his hopelessness.

Today patient reported that his recent interviews with Google did not go as well as he would have liked. This made him feel angry and pessimistic about the future. I engaged by providing empathetic and reflective listening and working to help patient to gain perspective on his thoughts and clarify his feelings. This remains a difficult task, though patient reports continuing to feel thankful and engaged in treatment.
